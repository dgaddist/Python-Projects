Finance Analysis Project
-Using NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn

Data Transformation and Cleaning

Utilized pandas drop function to remove unnecessary columns and employed regex to filter out null/blank values.
Data Visualization

Created a bar chart using Seaborn to visualize the number of male vs. female investors, revealing that males have a higher investment rate.
Used Seaborn to generate a bar chart displaying the average age of investors, with the majority between 21-35 years old and age 27 being the most prominent.
Developed subplots (two bar charts) using Matplotlib and Seaborn to compare gender-based investments in both investment avenues and the stock market, with males leading in both categories.
Created a point plot to analyze the median age of investors based on investment purposes: 27 years old for wealth creation, 29 years for saving for the future, and 30 years for returns.
Data Load

Uploaded the cleaned and visualized data to the appropriate GitHub repository.
